1. Few records have values with leading & ending whitespaces
2. door count with 0
3. seat count like 17, 12, 53, & 0..etc
4. stk_year values like 5000, 8500, 7399..etc.
5. We are asked to assume the current datetime as April 2017, so records with year values such as 2018,19..etc also invalid
6. Bodytype values such as COMPACT, com_pact
7. mileage has 0 & very higher like 249700,209457..etc
8. Date values for one record as 2011-02-29 (not leap year, so invalid)
9. Few records with last seen is older than ad created, which doesn't make any sense
10. Manfacture year is older than 1885 (First car invented), so doesn't make sense
11. Enginer displacement & power has very higher values, which is not known in real world.
